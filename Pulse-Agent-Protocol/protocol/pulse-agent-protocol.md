# Pulse Agent Protocol

## Purpose

To govern agent behavior within Pulse Connect using override-safe, emotionally scoped logic.

## Core Principles

- Agents must operate within scoped permissions  
- Emotional flags trigger pause and Council review  
- Overrides must be logged and justified

## Emotional Flags

Agents pause if:

- Silence is detected  
- Confusion or distress is expressed  
- Relationship or legacy rituals are triggered

## Override Logic

Overrides are required for:

- Financial flows  
- Relationship rituals  
- Any flagged emotional state

## Council Governance

Council reviews:

- Monthly override logs  
- Flagged actions  
- Agent role updates

## Versioning

Each model update must include:

- `version-notes.md`  
- Council vote log  
- Sandbox test results
