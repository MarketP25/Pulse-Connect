# Monthly Override Review Ritual

## Purpose

To ensure all agent overrides are justified, emotionally scoped, and legacy-safe.

## Steps

1. Run `override-review.js` to summarize override activity  
2. Review each entry in `override-history.json`  
3. Discuss unresolved flags in `flagged-actions.json`  
4. Submit Council feedback via `council-feedback.js`  
5. Update `agent-roles.json` if retraining or restriction is needed  
6. Founder closes the ritual with blessing or revision

## Schedule

- Held on the 28th of each month  
- Led by Council Admins  
- Final decision rests with Founder
